I'm a PhD candidate in the [School of Information Sciences](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Jana Diesner](https://jdiesnerlab.ischool.illinois.edu/). I am an alumni of the [Center for Artificial Intelligence Innovation (CAII)](https://ai.ncsa.illinois.edu/) at [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).

Research Interests
======
My research interests are broadly in Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science. My research goal is to make scientific literature more accessable using efficient and low-resource NLP techniques, especially in the biomedical domain. I'm also interested in revealing biases in LLMs through NLP downstream tasks.

Recent News
======
- [06/2024] Two paper accepted to [ACL 2024](https://2024.aclweb.org/) Workshops (BioNLP and GeBNLP)! See you in Bangkok!
- [05/2024] Our system in the shared task of [BioLaySumm 2024] (https://biolaysumm.org/) achieved the BEST performance among over 50 submissions.
